              I had the opportunity to lead the redesign of Absa’s value-added services purchasing feature in the banking app. This is an e-commerce solution at heart, however banks have a unique advantage regarding e-commerce, as they already have customer trust, customer loyalty, and payment details, all of which are often major challenges for regular e-commerce sites.
            </p>
            <p>
              Because user research revealed this early on, we were able to leverage the unique strengths of the bank, to create streamlined and seamless buying experience.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Absa Buy feature allows users to purchase products such as:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>
                Airtime and data
              </li>
              <li>
                Prepaid electricity, water and gas
              </li>
              <li>
                Lotto tickets
              </li>
              <li>
                Flight tickets
              </li>
              <li>
                Bus tickets
              </li>
              <li>
                Event tickets
              </li>
            </ul>

              The research and concept phase of the project quickly revealed that vastly different experiences would be required for different products within the VAS offering. Vouchers, electricity, flights and concert tickets, for example, are all purchased in different contexts, and their purchasing experiences have unique design requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
              The Absa Buy feature demanded new component and pattern designs, with the challenge being to achieve uniformity with the rest of the design ecosystem.

            <p>
              Extensive user research informed the project from early stages, beginning with card-sorting and user interviews, to understand how best to position the wide range of products.
            </p>
            <p>
              Various design and business stakeholders were brought into the project to assist in integrating a new feature with such an established application. Collaboration and scalable design thinking were crucial to the success of Absa Buy.
            </p>
            <p>
              While the project offered the opportunity to create purpose-built buying journeys, the need to balance innovative design with technological capabilities was also crucial. The team adopted an agile approach from the outset, in order to minimise feedback time and enable fast design iterations.

              I had the opportunity to contribute to the design direction of this project, while remaining deeply involved in the design. This allowed me to contribute to the organisation in multiple ways, including:

            <ul>
              <li>
                Introducing Apple Wallet and Google Wallet vouchers to app’s functionality
