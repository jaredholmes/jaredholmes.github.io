            <p>
              Absa Credit Coach was designed with a seemingly-simple problem in mind: how could we demystify credit profiles? As a designer the answer seemed simple: make information comprehensible and relevant for users of all backgrounds. To do this, it was clear that credit bureau data and internal bank data could be harnessed synergistically to create a powerful solution.
            </p>
            <p>
              While this seemed like a straightforward task, exploration revealed that creating what our users needed would require multi-departmental, even inter-organisational collaboration. This, combined with the market-leading nature of this project, made Credit Coach a challenge in managing complexity.

              Non-digital customers are often forgotten in a digitally-led world; the goal for Credit Coach was to ensure that this would not be the case. To create an omni-channel solution that was both seamless and integrated required a service design-led approach, analysing large ecosystems and established processes.
            </p>
            <p>
              The breadth of design also warranted extensive user research, gathering insights from quantitative big data sources and qualitative user interviews and case studies.

            <p>
              Innovative initiatives such as behavioural banking require fine balancing of value propositions, in order to create outcomes that benefit both the business and the customer. Situations like this often require behaviour change on the part of the customer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Designing for behaviour change amongst a host of constraints – technology, systems, business and design, to name a few – was a challenge of this project, and maintaining the overarching vision and strategy was crucial for it’s success.

              Credit Coach is a large, far-reaching initiative. This called for a host of functions on my part, including:
            </p>
            <ul>
             <li>Service blueprinting, in collaboration with CX colleagues</li>
             <li>Designing value propositions to satisfy many stakeholders, in departments spanning from credit risk, to design, to senior leadership</li>
             <li>Hosting review sessions and workshops</li>
             <li>Consensus-building by socialising designs with senior leadership</li>
             <li>User research, including user interviews, competitor analysis, behavioural economics research and big data analysis using Pandass</li>
             <li>Integrating component designs with an established design system</li>
             <li>UX design and prototyping</li>
            </ul>
